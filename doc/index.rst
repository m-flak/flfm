FLFM -- The Flask File Manager
==============================
Flask File Manager, or FLFM, is designed to allow the exploration of a server
from the comfort of a web browser.

FLFM can be used on either an external or internal server. It's up to you; the
choice is yours!

For general information on setting up FLFM, check out *The FLFM ReadMe* (below).
